The codes used to define transcriptional and cellular mechanisms driving whole-joint regeneration in our publication: "Dynamic cell fate plasticity and tissue integration drive functional synovial joint regeneration"

scRNAseq libraries were analyzed using R version 4.4.0 in RStudio with Seurat (v5.0.3.).

R package Monocle3 (v1.3.7) was used for pseudotime trajectory analysis.

The Zebrabow Analysis code takes the form of a MATLAB App script (.mlapp). It may also be dependent on MATLAB version 2024a and additional toolboxes downloaded (particularly the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and the Image Processing Toolbox).
